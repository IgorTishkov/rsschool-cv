###About me
I am 35 years old. I have wife and two children. Since 2009, I have been managing various internet companies. Since 2016 I have been a co-owner of the PROTUTOR tutoring center. Now I want to stay front-end developer, because I like all about programming. I led the development department of 12 people 6 years. And now I will developer to.

My strengths

I am very observant. I already do all, what written in a technical task. I am 80% perfectionist))) It mean that I know, when I need stop. I think perfectionism is nob best character for a developer. And I want to mention that I like everything related to technology.

My experience
Now I have not many experience in programming. I make some web pages to my site. For example I made page [like this](https://www.protutor.by/repetitory/angliiskii-yazyk/minsk) or [like this page](https://www.protutor.by/)
